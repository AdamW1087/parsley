/** A common interface for a debug frontend for a debugger to present the debug tree. Inherit from
  * one of the two provided subtraits to use.
  *
  * Any compliant implementation that handles all nodes of a `parsley.debugger.DebugTree` can be
  * used in place of any other implementation (e.g. a serialiser to JSON, a GUI, etc.).
  *
  * If a frontend is reusable, one can implement it as either an `object` or a `class`, but an `object`
  * is recommended. Either way, it should inherit [[ReusableFrontend]].
  *
  * If a frontend is single-use (e.g. it has some non-reusable state), never implement it as an `object`. Always
  * implement single-use frontends as a `class` of some sort inheriting from [[SingleUseFrontend]].
  *
  * If the results of some processing of a tree are needed out of a frontend, create a frontend class that accepts
  * some continuation parameter of `ReturnType => Unit` and call it somewhere within the implementation.
  *
